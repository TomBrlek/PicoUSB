You just got an empty PicoUSB? Here's how to program it:

## Setup

1. Download the latest [CircuitPython for Rasperry Pi Pico](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/).
2. Insert PicoUSB into your USB drive while holding the "Boot" button. (Opens it in a bootloader mode. The first time you do this you don't have to hold the "Boot" button)
3. Copy `CircuitPython.uf2` file to the USB and wait for few seconds or a minute for it to finish setting up. (will close and reopen the explorer, be patient)
4. Download/Clone the contents of this repository.
5. Open the USB device in explorer and copy/paste everything from `./src/` into it. (Replace all)

That is it! Modify `pico_usb.txt` to change the functionality. See below to know what to do next.

## Operation

- Inserting the PicoUSB while not holding any buttons will not show as a USB drive and will execute the "bad usb" code found in the pico_usb.txt.
- Inserting it while holding the "Mode" button will not execute any "bad usb" code and will show as a USB drive. This way you can freely edit the code.
- If you insert it while holding the "Boot" button, it will open in bootloader mode. This is usually only used the first time the device is set up and never again.

## Important Files

> [!CAUTION]
> Changing any python can result in **permanently bricking your device**. Be very careful when modifying `boot.py` as disabling the USB drive without a failsafe could render the device useless!
> Be careful when writing your own micropython scripts! The developers are not responsible if you brick your own device this way!

- pico_usb.txt - here is where your executable pseudo-code is located.
- layout.txt - here is where you select your keyboard layout.
- code.py - interpreter that executes your pesudo code. Free to modify.
- boot.py - this code executes before the USB is recognised. Free to modify.

**pico_usb.txt API:**

- `#`         - must be the first character in the line. That line will be ignored.
- `delay`     - waits for the specified amount of time before resuming execution. Example: `delay 0.8`
- `press`     - presses one or more buttons once. For example to press enter, use `press enter`. To "select all", use `press control + a`. Press also causes the Pico to release all keys after being executed.
- `write`     - sequentially presses many buttons in a row. example: `write Hello world!`
- `writefile` - reads a file and uses the contents as keypresses. Make sure the file isn't too large (>100kB). example: `writefile commands.txt`
- `hold`      - presses and holds down one or more buttons until `release` is called
- `release`   - releases **all** held keys
- `move x, y` - moves the mouse on the main display to the given location, from the current location as a reference. negative x = left, possitive x = right, negative y = down, possitive y = up.
- `click btn` - clicks the mouse. `btn` is the mouse button, options are left, right, middle
- `scroll`    - scrolls the mouse. Negative number scrolls down, possitive scroll up
- `volume x`  - Modifies the system volume. Negative numbers move the volume slider down by x, possitive move it up by x. min volume = 0. max = 100. `volume mute` mutes the speakers.
- `loop`      - loops everything after this command up until the end of the file
- `loop x`    - same as loop but stops after x times

## Development

1. Create a new venv: `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate the venv: `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (Windows) or `source .venv\Scripts\activate` (Unix)
3. Install stubs: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
